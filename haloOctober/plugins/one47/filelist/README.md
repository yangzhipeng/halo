# FileList 
### Plugin for OctoberCMS ###

This plugin for OctoberCMS is based on [Carousel-Plugin](https://github.com/SaifurRahmanMohsin/Carousel-Plugin) Bootstrap Carousel plugin for October CMS.

**FileList** enables a backend user to easily upload files and display them on a page with a Description and a Downloadable link. The description is listed first then the title is listed as a list item and is a link to download the file. 

I made this because I had a specific need for it and it helped me to learn plugin development for OctoberCMS. 

## Thanks to: ##

[Saifur Rahman Mohsin](http://october.imoz.in/) for the Bootstrap Carousel Plugin
and
[Alexey Bobkov and Samuel Georges](http://octobercms.com) for OctoberCMS.

Note: If you want to install via GitHub, create a directory called 'one47' within the 'plugins' directory of your OctoberCMS installation.
